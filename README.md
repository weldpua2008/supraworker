# Supraworker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/weldpua2008/supraworker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/weldpua2008/supraworker) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)

The abstraction layer around jobs, allows pull a job from your API periodically, call-back your API, observe execution time and to control concurrent execution.

It's responsible for getting the bash commands from your API running it, and streaming the logs back to your API. It also sends state updates to your API.

## Getting started

```bash
$ go get github.com/weldpua2008/supraworker
```

Define config at `$HOME/supraworker.yaml`:

>[!WARNING] Keys are not case sensitivity (https://github.com/spf13/viper/pull/635#issuecomment-580659676):
> Viper's default behaviour of lowercasing the keys for key insensitivity is incompatible
> with these standards and has the side effect of making it difficult for
> use cases such as case sensitive API credentials in configuration.
> For eg: MyApiKey=MySecret


```yaml
clientId: "my_uniq_client_id"
